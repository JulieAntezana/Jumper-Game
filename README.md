Jumper Game

There are old skydivers and bold skydivers,
but there are no old, bold skydivers.

Rules
Jumper is played according to the following rules.

The puzzle is a secret word randomly chosen from a list.
The player guesses a letter in the puzzle.
If the guess is correct, the letter is revealed.
If the guess is incorrect, a line is cut on the player's parachute.
If the puzzle is solved the game is over.
If the player has no more parachute the game is over.
